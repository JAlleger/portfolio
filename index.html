  <span class="center"> <h1> <em> My History </em> </h1> </span>
 
   <p> I graduated high school in 2018, took one year of college, and figured that there were better alternatives
    to learn skills. As important as getting a better education is, it's better to know what your target is before
    you go off shooting your shot. Not knowing what I truly wanted to do I grabbed the first job that looked my
    way. I spent two years as a cellphone salesman at target mobile before being promoted to team lead. At
    Target mobile I specialized in AT&T phone contracts and AT&T Internet/TV sales. We also worked closely
    with official target staff to stock our shelves, assist in register checkouts, and provide guest assistance.
    At the same time, I was working as a Geek Squad attendant at BestBuy next door. At Geek Squad I learned to
    think critically and quickly in diagnosing tech issues on computers. As well as various software fixes and
    small computer repairs. Using the connections I made at target mobile and my new titles of Target Team lead
    and Geek Squad technician, I transferred to a job at Simply Mac as a technician. Finally, I found my way to an independent repair
    shop that repairs: Phones, Tablets, laptops, all Mac products, etc. Since I'm still uncertain about what path
    I'm going to be taking in life, I figured learning to code would be a good skill set to help me out with
    my search for the future.
    My Interests are in coding, 3D design, and story writing. My current hobbies are gumpla building, gaming,
    Figuring out 3D modeling, and just writing small stories for myself. I'm skilled in both phone and
    computer repairs. I'm an Apple certified tech with the hopes to be Samsung certified soon. I have good
    salesmanship skill and patience to watch paint dry. And soon to have a large range of coding skills
